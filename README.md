# Domion-X.Net

This repo contains a library to ease ASP.NET Core web application development, along with sample applications and automated tests.

This is the "Big brother" EXPERIMENTAL repo of [Domion.Net](https://github.com/mvelosop/Domion.Net).

The library and applications have beed developed along a series of post in my blog at [http://www.coderepo.blog](http://www.coderepo.blog) (in spanish).

Whatever I publish in my [blog](http://www.coderepo.blog) related to [Domion](http://www.coderepo.blog/domion/) is tried and evaluated here first, so this is the fast changing version.

The series starts with [Domion - Un sistema para desarrollar aplicaciones en .NET Core](http://www.coderepo.blog/domion/)

Hope this helps someone.
